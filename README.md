# Project name: Weather-Journal App Project
# Project description: 
-In this project i created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.
- I setup the Node environment with Express, body-parser and cors.
- I create local server with port 4000.
- I setup the server with Get and Post routs.
- I used Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes.
- I used openweathermap API to get the temperature based on zip code.
-In server.js file , I write the setup packages codes, setup server code , Post and Get request codes
-In app.js : I write the code of the Api key & the basic URL which I got it from openweathermap API, the click event function to listen to the click on Generate Button by user , async function to get weather data , the post request date to be sent to the server and UI update data.
-I used catch & error to assure that codes run and return with the right results.
-In each step I used the console.log to test my codes.
