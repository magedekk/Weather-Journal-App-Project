# Weather-Journal-App-Project
In this project i created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App. - I setup the Node environment with Express, body-parser and cors. - I create local server with port 4000. - I setup the server with Get and Post routs. - I used Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes. - I used openweathermap API to get the temperature based on zip code. -In server.js file , I write the setup packages codes, setup server code , Post and Get request codes -In app.js : I write the code of the Api key &amp; the basic URL which I got it from openweathermap API, the click event function to listen to the click on Generate Button by user , async function to get weather data , the post request date to be sent to the server and UI update data. -I used catch &amp; error to assure that codes run and return with the right results. -In each step I used the console.log to test my codes.
